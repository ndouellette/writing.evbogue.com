I own my email address. It's from my own domain name. This means, no matter what, you can reach me here. For years I didn't. I oursourced my email address to organizations like Yahoo, NYU, and Google. But now, I don't.

Now, I wonder, why I didn't always use [ev@evbogue.com](mailto:ev@evbogue.com). 

The truth is, when you're on another service, they own your incoming shit. Some of the most well known places for serving free email accounts have been accused of filtering out stuff they don't want you to receive. If you want to send Piratebay links to fuckbook, good luck. If you want to send your porn through Apple's authoritarian mail system, best wishes to you. 

This is troubling to me, because email has been and can continue to be a distributed system. But when you trust a megacorporation with your email you have to know you're at risk. And you are at risk.

Not to scare you. But things could get much worse in your inbox, if you're outsourcing it to a company that wants to turn a profit on your brain.

Instead, why not liberate yourself? Use your own domain name for your email address. If you're even ballsier, host your own mail and smtp servers. 

This way, no one can filter out messages 'they' don't want you to receive. And also, you'll own your email address. 

Then, you can take it with you when you go.
