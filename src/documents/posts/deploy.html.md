Deploy is a new word in my vocabulary. Up until around six months ago, it was something I thought soldiers did in parts of the world the United States army shouldn't be. Now, it's taken on a whole new meaning. 

Deploy.

First there were web master.
Then there were web designers.
Now there are web developers. 

From what I've gathered of the web dev scene, from pouring nearly all of my energy into learning and understanding Node.js, web developers deploy apps for you.

Why? Because the age of centralized apps is fading. In the near future, we'll look back at 2006-2012 as if remembering a bad SWSX hangover. Why? Because almost every centralized service is being replaced by an ultra-fast distributed Node.js app. 

Do you want collaborative editing? We have that.

Do you want a chat room? We have plenty of those?

Do you want realtime analytics? No. Really. Real time. And not simultaneously mega-corp spyware.

Do you want a simple blog engine? Code one yourself.

2013 is the year of deployment. Hundreds of tiny personal apps are in your future.
