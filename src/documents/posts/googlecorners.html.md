title: Hire me at Google to find all of the people hiding in corners

I'm still waiting to here back from Coinbase. Hint, I'd like to hear a yes, or no. So I figured, why not write another resume?

I already have one job application in to Google, why not submit another? We all know Google is now a massive sprawling company where no one knows who is doing what. And this is exactly what I hope to solve.

Hire me at Google to find all of the people who are hiding out in corners hoping not be noticed. 

You know the type, the 5' 10" programmer, receding hairline. He pretends to know a little C++, actually makes do with Ruby on Rails and a tiny bit of Python. He doesn't need or want a corner office, but instead ended up in that office far in the back, around the corner, where no one knows where he is. He has an unrecognizable face, and thus is unaccountable, to anyone. Larry doesn't know who he is. Sergey doesn't know who he is. Of course Eric doesn't know who he is. Because Google doesn't use Github, no one knows that this employee hasn't contributed anything to the codebase in well over three years. 

Meanwhile, he's taking home $90,000 a year, hitting refresh on his Google+ account all day in-between brief trips to sip fresh coconut smoothies at the dining hall.

We all know Google would lose 20% of its value in five seconds in a lightning fast HFT disaster if it has a bad quarter. So let's hire me to avoid this disaster by discovering, and firing, all of the employees at Google who aren't contributing anything.

And while we're at it, I'll stop by Vic's office and tell him that we give him permission to say whatever the hell he wants to again, on whatever service he wants to. Why the shush order? Are you afraid he might say something you don't want to hear? As long as Vic is having opinions, and doing the work, I promise to never let him go.

Listen. It's a hard job, finding semi-chubby middling programmers who are deathly afraid of losing their cushy ride on the Google bus home to Delores Park every evening. These programmers are quiet, nearly invisible. Without a skilled person like me in the job, you'll probably never find them. They will slip through the cracks, and Google will continue to pay them from now until the Singularity. 

Someone has to search, locate, and fire these people. It might as well be me.

Once I'm done at Mountain View, I will gladly take a company credit card and jetset to and from Google campuses all over the world. I'll start by laying off the entire population at the Boulder campus. None of them (except the cleaning lady) seemed to be doing any work when I walked by. I'll even stop by Google's secret ghetto for the untalented they don't want to let go: Motorola Mobility in Chicago. There are still untalented people hiding out there. I know, because I haven't seen anything cool out of Motorola since the original Razr. Let's save these less-talented individuals the trip to Merchandise Mart, and send them packing right now.

Look, no one wants to be the person who goes around letting useless people go. 

Have you seen anyone else raise their hand? 

Everyone at Google wants to be liked. Larry wants to be liked, Sergey wants to be liked. And Eric, well, he wants to keep up his busy schedule traveling to exotic unconnected parts of the world and seeing just how far Android adoption has come in the past six months. 

Let's let Eric keep traveling, and I'll start making hard decisions.

I'll start by stopping by Larry's office for a day. Is he just having panic attacks, or is he actually contributing to the daily grind of trying to figure out how Google Search can begin competing with Duck Duck Go? And Sergey, is he just dicking around with his Google Glasses all day? On Tuesday I'll follow him around and see if he's commited any code. No code? Alright Sergey, it's time to go.

Because ultimately, isn't Google just a monsterous codebase? Let's get some people actually working on it. We can't let another day go by with Kevin Rose feeding his dog premium snacks from the lunch room. Those snacks were meant to fuel ravenous coder minds, Kevin. Not intended as dog food. 

It's time to hire someone who's willing to do the work, and find the people who are sitting around doing nothing at your company.

Everyone who works at Google loves Google too much to watch it end up like AOL and Yahoo.

If you know someone who can hire me for this positon at Google, please forward this post to them.

Google, you can reach me at ev@evbogue.com. I deleted my gmail account.

I know no one wants to fire Chris Messina. Let it be me.
