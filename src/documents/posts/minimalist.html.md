One thing you should know about me is this: I live out of one bag.

In various ways, I've lived out of a bag since 2009. This has given me a lot of opportunities, but it's also led to some very interesting problems.

I've scaled up my lifestyle to living in a hotel in Mexico overlooking the water for a month. I've scaled down my life to be able to wander wherever I want. I can pack up and be gone within moments. I can be settled in within moments.

I like living this way. It gives me a lot of flexibility to go where I want. It also lets me take bigger risks, and fail harder than most people. It lets me succeed bigger, and enjoy my successes more than most people, too.

I bought the bag I have from Mission Workshop in San Francisco in 2011, on my way to Mexico. Maren Kate was there when I bought it. This was before she hit the big jackpot with Zirtual.

I was staying at a hostel in the Tenderloin. I transferred all of my stuff that would fit to the new container, and gave the rest to the people at the hostel.

Living this way allowed me to travel almost all of last year (2012). I visited the coffee shops of Kyoto. The sushi restaurants of Tokyo. The biergartens of Berlin. I got to see Gigabyte Fiber get switched on in Kansas City. 

It also allowed me to run out of money in Boulder, and land on the streets at the start of winter. It allowed me to move to GB's grandmother's basement in NC, where I've been living since.

Living this way will let me throw all of my stuff in a bag, and be in San Francisco or New York as soon as someone needs what I can offer them.

A funny thing that happens on the way to being minimalist is jealousy. A lot of people wish they could live this way, but very people actually try it. I don't understand why they don't try it, if they really want to. It's not too hard, just rent a dumpster, and throw all of your shit in it.

But it is that hard. That's why people keep asking me for advice on how to do it. I don't have any advice for you.

People get really attached to their shit. I can't figure out why, which probably means the part of my brain that gets attached to shit is damaged. Or perhaps I have aspergers. Maybe I'm just really good at mourning the loss. I'm not sure, you tell me.

Regardless, you shouldn't be jealous of me. I lived in a hotel two years ago for a month. I was homeless a few months ago. Things change, but one things stays the same. I still live out of a bag.

The reason I don't write about minimalism anymore is twofold. One, I've outgrown talking about it - I just live it. Two, living like this has in the past overshadowed everything else in my life. Living out of a bag is so unique, people want to put me on the news and stuff. And they have.

But no one wants to put you on the news when you run out of money and can't find a place to sleep, let alone get access to drinking water in the middle of the night, in a town full of people who consider themselves to be rich.

I live like this because it lets me experience the ups and downs of success and failure. It gives me the freedom to take risks, such as shutting down my old businesses, or deleting my old world in order to see what comes next.

So you want to know the secret art of being minimalist?

Throw your shit in a dumpster.
