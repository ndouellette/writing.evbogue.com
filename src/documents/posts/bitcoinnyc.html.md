New York's the first place I've been in the world so far that's aware of Bitcoin. Almost every room I've walked into over the pst 48 hours since I've been back, there's been someone who has heard of Bitcoin.

This is exciting, because I believe Bitcoin can catch on here fast. If people are aware of it, they're close to being willing to accept it. 

What are you going to do with this information? Well, if you're in New York, know that Bitcoin doesn't have the same scare factor that it does in the rest of the world. This means if you're looking to accept or earn in Bitcoin, New York is the place to be.
