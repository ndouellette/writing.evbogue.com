Four more days at the North Carolina retreat from the wintertime. All I can say is I'm grateful for this time to stay still, read, and learn. 

When I started here, I barely knew how Node.js worked. I was hesitent to type 'npm install'. Which is funny to me now. Because what would my life be without 'npm install'? Or the command-line.

I've been reading Steve Jobs's biography. I used to work for Steve Jobs. People don't know this about me, because I don't tell them. After I graduated from NYU (in three years, I boast), I was recruited to help open the Apple Store on 5th Avenue. Which is Apple's flagship.

I was really good in the launch, but struggled with the mundane repetativeness of the daily retail grind. So I quit after 6 months to go work for New York Magazine. 

But my time with Apple was time with Steve. I'd always been a Mac user, but working at Apple made me really bitter and resentful about the whole thing. Now that Apple is falling apart, and we've completely mourned the loss of Steve. I think it's time to look forward at what technology will look like in the next ten years, instead of looking back at the last ten.

I have a vision for the device of the future. If you [email me](ev@evbogue.com), I'll tell you about it. 

If someone gave me $100,000, right now, I'd have the resources to build a prototype. One of my first missions in NYC is to poke around places like Makerbot and Ada Fruit to see if they have the access to parts and technical people who can help me build this device I've been dreaming of.

It's the kind of thing that would make your iPhone look like the piece of crap it is. Just like the iPhone made my Motorola Razr I used during the Apple Store launch look like a piece of crap.

New technologies always make old technologies look like shit. 

cjdns makes the old-fashioned system of routing on the Internet look like shit. Bitcoin makes the Federal Reserve look like shit. Node makes Ruby on Rails look like shit. 

When I say shit, I mean obsolete. Because that's what technology becomes, obsolete. We discard obsolete technologies. Those of us who have a healthy relationship with technology anyway. Those of us who can look clearly at what is in front of us and say 'oh, crap, what I'm using is obsolete now.' Then we pick up a new tech thingy that does things better.
