For the past six months, I used Ubuntu as the only operating system on my computer. A Macbook Air. Or, as they say in the Linux world: an MBA. 

A day ago, I bricked my MBA trying to switch from Ubuntu to Debian. I wanted to get 'more hardcore' but ended up reinstalling Mac OS X. So now, I'm rocking Snow Lion. Just like everyone else. I figure I'll stay here until I'm motivated to move back to Linux, or perhaps life will take me in another direction.

In many ways, using Ubuntu for six months was a detox. I compare it to trying to be vegan for a year -- hard work, but it really cleans your body out. It brought me closer in touch with the roots of the computer(s) I use every day. I learned more in the past six months than I have in a long while.

Here are a few observations from my six-month Linux retreat.

1. Git is brilliant. I barely knew about Git before I switched to Linux. Now, I use it every day. The first thing I installed on my brand-new copy of Snow Lion was Git. I use Git for everything now. Pretty much all of my data is being stored in Git. All of the content on this website is version controlled. I can move through space/time and watch how this site evolves. 

2. Hello again, command line. I used to use the command line a lot on Mac OS X. But over the years, the GUI got farther and farther away from it. Now that I'm back on the Mac, I've found myself using the bash more. 

3. Mac OS X has stagnated. Linux for me was an ever-changing experience. Because the open source world is moving and changing, there's always something new to update or install. New features, new bug fixes. There are distributed teams tweaking and modifying almost everything. Mac OS X on the other hand seems to have completely stagnated over the past 2 years. Don't get me wrong, it's really stable. But not much has changed since Steve died. Maybe this is for the best, for now.

4. VPS. I'm running a Debian VPS now. After wrestling with a handful of PaaS containers for Node deploys, I ended up launching myself into the deep end. It turns out the deep end is actually a lot easier to work with. I'd definitely recommend rocking Linux on your VPS if you plan on deploying Node.

5. Linux GUI's aren't better than Mac OS X yet. I'm not a GUI person, I deploy web apps. I'm not working on GUI. I don't want to work on GUI. However, I found myself constantly wrestling with Linux's user interface. It's WAY better than it was 10 years ago, but coming back to Mac, it's refreshing to have everything work as advertised. It's nice to let the OS take care of itself, so I can futz with the emerging edge of web deployment.

I'm not sure if I'll go back to Linux. I might in a week, I might not. I think what I'm looking for, and what Linux needs, is amazing hardware aimed square at Linux people. This means open everything, because Linux works best when nothing is proprietary. If and when Linux get some incredibly cool dedicated hardware, I predict the Linux scene will explode.
