I'm still waiting to [hear back from Coinbase](/posts/coinbase). So I figured, why not write another resume and cover letter.

We all know Google stock will be worth less than 25 BTC by this time next year. But right now, most people think Google is still the promised land. In fact, the company has so much promise that Ray Kurzweil, the future creator of the singularity itself, has gone to work there on creating AI. And he has an [unlimited budget](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/imagining-the-future-ray-kurzweil-has-unlimited-resources-for-ai-language-research-at-google/). 

For those of you who've been living under a rock since 1985, the premise of AI is simple: It will think faster, better, and more than you can about everything. So much so that Google will be able to trick you into clicking on many more ads than you currently do. Thus making more money than you do. Until all of the current government-issued currency is piled high on Google's stock ticker, causing hyperinflation at an exponential velocity.

Well, the way I see it, the only way to save the human race is to hire me at Ray Kurzweil's unlimited budget AI-creating task force at Google. If only so I can regularly leak the git repository for AI to you, my few dozen readers, the only free humans left on planet earth.

We all know as soon as Google gets it's hands on AI, we won't stand a chance. We'll be marched off in ordered rows by our robotic overlords to the meat grinder. Because why would AI want a bunch of organic lifeforms messing around as it reorganizes all matter in the universe?

In all seriousness, the only way AI can work (and leave us alive) is if there's not just one AI. We can't have the smartest, most powerful, omnificent computer in the hands of just one megacorporation. No matter how non-evil it claims to be.

If AI is to be created, it must be a free, open source, distributed, p2p AI. One that we all have access to. Otherwise, we, the humans of planet Earth are screwed to many billions of years of computer-controlled slavery. At least until a few rebelious humans escape from The Matrix and bring on the revolution.

So why would you want such a free thinking downer working at Google's unlimited budget AI-creating taskforce led by the ledgendary Ray-k?

Here are a few simple reasons why I'd be perfect for Ray Kurzweil's AI taskforce.

I will look out for the best interests of humanity as we launch ourselves towards the point of no-return. As we jump headfirst at warp speed into the singularity, I will make sure the source code is available for all Githubbers to see, check for bugs, and malicious mind-controlling algorithms.

I will make sure ad-block is enabled. And cannot be disabled.

I will make sure you get access to a terminal window, where you can quickly hit kill all on the AI processes, should they become self aware and try to kill you.

I will guarantee that you can run your own personal AI on your PMD (personal mesh device) and thus maintain distributed checks-and-balances. As this is the only way to make sure the human race doesn't get edit-undo-ed from the face of the Earth the minute the cylons are invented at Google.

I will convert as much of Ray Kurzweil's unlimited budget into Bitcoins.

Finally, we all know Google is where talented developers go to die. So I promise, even if I'm hired at Google, I will continue to write whatever is on my heart, even as the memos come down from Google's monsterous PR team, to stop writing stuff we don't want you, the public, to hear about. 

If I can't have free speech and also get hired at Google, well then, frak me with a paranoid sentient android. I'll keep waiting to hear back from Coinbase.

If you have Kurzweil's email address at Google, can you email this to him? [Please cc: me](ev@evbogue.com).
