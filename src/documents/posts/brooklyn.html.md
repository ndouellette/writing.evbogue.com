It's good to be back in Brooklyn. 

I first moved to Brooklyn after my sophemore year at NYU. The first neighborhood I moved into was Williamsburg. I shared a $650-each apartment off the Graham Ave L-train for three years. This would be a home for three years. 

I tried to leave Brooklyn after my internship at Nymag at the end of 2006, but failed horribly when Nymag.com offered me a job. Having already given notice in Williamsburg, I got invited to see a room at a giant loft in Bushwick called The Schoolhouse. This ended up being my home for another three years.

In the summer of 2009, I quit everything. I quit my job, I left The Schoolhouse. I quit smoking. I threw out all of my stuff and headed off to Portland. Four months later I ended up back in Brooklyn, where I shared a place in South Slope.

After traveling the world, I realize now just how amazing Brooklyn is. New York is the most diverse city on the planet. There is no other city quite like it. Most other cities have small ethnic minorities, next to monocultures. Brooklyn has every culture, everywhere. 

Now I've landed back at the schoolhouse. Where we've played uno, had wine. I'm getting back into the groove of things.

I keep saying that I'm back in Brooklyn forever-ish*. I mean it. After being away, I realize how valuable a place like this is. 

So here I am. To stay. Forever-ish*.

*or until the day comes that I want to leave again.
