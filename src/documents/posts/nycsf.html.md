During my life, I've lived a lot of places. Longest, and most notably, New York City and San Francisco. I've also traveled a lot. Singapore, Puerto Vallarta, Tokyo, Berlin. I've been to a lot of American cities. I tried to live in Seattle, Kansas City, Boulder, Portland. When I first moved to SF Bay, I lived in Oakland for a bit. I grew up in Chicago, a city that never made any sense to me, at all.

What I can tell you is this: the entire world looks to New York and San Francisco. Everywhere I've been, everyone talks about New York and San Francisco. 

When I was in Berlin, everyone wanted to move to New York.
When I was in Singapore, everyone was trying to emulate the valley.
When I was in Kansas City, everyone wanted to move to New York.
When I was in Boulder, everyone was trying to emulate the valley.

There are a lot of places in the world trying to 'be the next tech scene'. Everyone wants to be able to compete. The trouble is, you can't compete. 

All of the talent is in two places. New York, and San Francisco. 

This is why I've decided to focus my attention on working only in one of these two places. For me, it's a choice between two amazing places. Not four thousand crappy ones.

There are exceptions. There are reclusive coders spread out over the globe who contribute amazing things to open source. But the truth of the matter is, the most amazing melting pots of talent are New York and San Francisco.

Yes, this means these places are more expensive. This is because there's more competition. They're more expensive, because people who aren't talented inevitably wash out. 

As they say it in New York, if you can make it there...

But this saying isn't true in tech. If you're trying to make it in tech in Des Moines, you're not going to have access to the talent you have access to in San Francisco. There might be a handful of people who code, but wouldn't they be in SF if they were really worth their salt? I would say they are.

The reason everyone with talent eventually moves to SF and NY is culture. People are out and about in these cities. They meet on the streets. They sit down at sidewalk cafes and discuss implementation plans. Being in these cities, you also get access. When I'm in SF and NY, I can sit down with any talented person I want to, because all of the talented people I want to sit down with live there.

The latest Star Trek movie has images of San Francisco under attack by an alien race. Why? Because we feel like we might lose something if this city was destroyed. New York, ditto. No one makes movies about aliens destroying a suburb in [insert name of place you live other than NY or SF here]. Because our reaction would probably be: good riddance. 

You're now on notice, those of you trying to hire me. I am only speaking with you if you're in New York or San Francisco. If you are not in one of these two places, well... when are you moving?
