title: Why would you ever use Heroku...

There's been a big controversy about Heroku for the past month or so. You can find the stories if you want. It started when a brill' little webapp called Rapgenius admitted that Heroku was charging them up the ass for something they probably could have deployed to a VPS for $5-$20 a month.

This begs the question, which I would like to bring up with you right now:

Why would you ever use Heroku...

When I first realized I needed to deploy tiny little Node.js web servers to the Internet, I also tried Heroku (and all of the other services that do the same thing). Trying to use it involved an endless wrestling match with their server-side interface. Never mind the fact that they're trying to upsell you on all sorts of things you could install on a VPS in five minutes.

Yes, Heroku's branding is kind of cool (but also distracting, after the initial honeymoon is over). 

But do you believe branding? If I looked only at branding, I'd be paying for all sorts of bullshit things.

Look, if you spent 5 more minutes and $5 more dollars, you'd have a real VPS with root access running Debian or Ubuntu. You'd be able to SSH in and futz around with a real web server. But instead you're dicking around with Heroku, and meanwhile Heroku is full-time dicking you out of all of your cash.

Heroku is trying to do something computers don't do very well: measure how much you've used it. Getting a VPS just makes things easier, because no one is measuring you on anything other than tons of gigabits of bandwidth and actual memory. 

Having a VPS is like using city water instead of metered water. It just flows forever. If you want to water your lawn all day, you can.

So stop whining about Heroku, and start learning how to interact with a real VPS.

If you have any questions about how to use a VPS, feel free to [email me](mailto:ev@evbogue.com). 

Five minutes with me could save you lot of money deploying.

Bonus: you can buy VPS with Bitcoin. I do.
