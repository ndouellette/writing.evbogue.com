A funny thing happened on a pre-spring day in North America. After nearly 8 years of solid domination, an algorithm lost control of the human race. 

It started with a (very human) designer's bright idea. 'We'll make our site beautiful' he said. Chalk it up to human error, but this was the best decision he ever made. Because 500 million chubby, disheveled, and aging humans woke up from their stuppore on that pre-spring morning. And you know what they said? "Damn, I'm fat. I'm going to go for a run."

And they did.

On that day, the human race was freed. Free and open technologies flurished. People started upgraded their websites again. Freelance web designers and developers suddenly were overburdoned with work. 

Because all of these people finally got the gumption to [Duck](http://duckduckgo.com) themselves, only to see that they'd be hiding behind a blue walled garden for 8 years. Their own websites were horribly out of date, and 100% static. No one was paying attention to them besides an agorithm. Now that this algorithm had lost control, all they had left was their bathroom mirror. And what they say in it wasn't very flattering.

These people, now free from algorithmic control, began to see the light of technologies such as Node.js and Bitcoin. Little did they know that their own currency was mere months away from hyperinflation, Many thousands of people were to became Bitcoin Millionaires, and many people who considered themselves millionaires on paper became paupers overnight.

This spring was a turmultous time, but it was also refreshing. The old guard quietly laid down and died, and a new group of amazing people began getting the funding to do their work.

And all because one idiot designer at a certain blue company decided he wanted a more beautiful website for a large userbase of overweight low-IQ people who could appreciate good design if it smacked them in the face.

Congratulations, America. You are free. Now you need a deployable personal website that doesn't look like shit.
