We all know Apple is lost. Tim Cook doesn't know anything about designing computers. Everyone is pretending to love Apple product releases. 

Being enthusiastic about Apple products is so ingrained in our muscle memory, most people can't help but salivate over the junk Apple puts out.

But let's face it, Apple hasn't done anything remarkable since Steve Jobs died. 

It's time to start innovating again.

It's time for me to return from exile, and help Apple return to it's former glory.

My first order of business will be firing Tim Cook, and the chubby British guy in those videos.

Next, I will invent the Macbook Carbon.

Have you seen the [Gigabyte X11 Carbon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq5lAmIBZJQ)? It's the lightest laptop computer on Earth. And it's not available in the United States of America. No, it's not because the USA is a third world country. It's only unavailable because Tim Cook has no vision.

For the past two years, Apple has only kept its marketshare by throwing lawyers at companies around the globe. And Gigabyte, despite creating the lightest and most beautiful computer in the world, does not want to go up against Apple.

I haven't wanted to buy an Apple product in over two years. The last Apple product I bought was an 11" Macbook Air. The computer I want is made out of carbon fiber. If the people who are making the decision at Apple won't release it, then you will have to hire me to make the decisions for them.

Here's the plan. 

Step 1. Purchase Gigabyte, and thus the rights to release the Macbook Carbon in the United States.

Step 2. Discontinue all of Apple's current product line. One more inch on everything has not done the trick. Like when Steve returned from exile, we will need time to reinvent the company. We can't do that and keep repping terrible products. The people will have to wait.

Step 3. Re-release the Gigabyte X11 as the Macbook Carbon. Apple's first, and for a time, only product. It's the perfect machine anyway.

Next, I will do what [I promised to do at Google](/posts/googlecorners). Find everyone hiding in corners at Apple, and fire them.

Then, in a surprising turn of events, all new Mac products will be installed with the free and open Linux distribution Ubuntu. Because it's better than Mac OS X, and Apple only uses the best.

The next product in the lineup, I can't tell you about. But it will change everything. (Hint, it involves [mesh networking](https://projectmeshnet.org/).)

So I leave you (the shareholders, board members, and disgruntled employees at Apple Computer) with this message... 

Do you want to continue to listen to a man who only knows how to add an inch to the top of an iPhone screen?

Or do you want to hear from the one person left on earth who has true vision for the company?

The Macbook Carbon awaits. 

You only have a few hard decisions to make.

When you've made up your minds, please send my private helicopter with the equivilent of 1 billion USD in Bitcoins to rescue me from this basement in North Carolina.
