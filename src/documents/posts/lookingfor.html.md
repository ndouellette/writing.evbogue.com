The ideal project I'd like to be working on is at the intersection of Node.js, Bitcoin, and mesh networking. I'm certain some interesting things will be happening in that space, and they already are in places like Hyperboria where almost everyone accepts Bitcoin already.

Node is great because it's new, it learned from the mistakes of many other systems that came before it. It's also beginning to reach maturity. This means finished projects can start to happen with Node as the underlying infrastructure.

I appreciate the modular nature of Node. $ npm install is an elegant solution, that only Golang can rival right now. The only difference is there's a hell of a lot more stuff being built for Node.js than there is for Golang right now. This could change, and this is why I'm watching Golang too.

The reason I got into development was because I went around the entire world trying to find developers who were interested in the problems I was trying to solve. I didn't find many. A lot of programmers get settled into a language, and don't want to look into the future --because it means everything they've learned in the past is becoming obsolete. 

I'm always trying to test whether or not what I'm using has become obsolete, and then upgrade to the new thing asap. This is the only way to stay ahead in the tech world right now. 

Bitcoin makes sending and receiving money simple. I realize that might seem crazy to say, as there's a huge barrier to entry on Bitcoin. But once people get over the barrier, all they want to do is use Bitcoins. No one likes interacting with payment processors and banks every time they use money. Bitcoin makes it so people don't have to. Payment processors and banks, watch out. Your time is near.

I'm fascinated with mesh networking because it undermines yet another industry, which is the cellphone and internet giants. Why can't my laptop be meshing with your laptop? The only reason we're not all connected is because 'they' don't want us to be. They being the people getting your $94 per month, with a two year contract.

I can't work for any of the old industries getting distrupted by these new technologies. 

If you're running obsolete infrastructure, you definitely don't want me around. My presence and work calls bullshit on your code.

What I am interested in is working on your Bitcoin, Node.js, or mesh networking project. 

Or if you have two million dollars, give it to me, and I'll get together a team to build something at the intersection of Node, Bitcoin and Hyperboria.
