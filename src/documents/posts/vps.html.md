One of the most prominent transitions happening in technology right now is the switch from static Apache-esque servers to virtual private servers (VPS). In the past having a static site was enough, but now it's 2013. It's time to upgrade.

You don't want to be left behind.

But how do you choose a VPS? There are so many options.

I've written before about why you should never use Heroku, but I also haven't given you much information about viable alternatives. Now I will. 

There are three factors you have to take into account when you're choosing a VPS.

1. Price. Do you want to pay in USD, or Bitcoin, or some other currency? Do you want to put your credit card on file, or do you want to load up an account with Paypal and prepay for your time? Do you want to be spending $5 per month, or $25? All good questions. Cheapest isn't always best, but it is some of the time. 

2. Juice. How much 'umph' does it have? We measure this in terms of RAM or memory. If your host is measuring in terms of strange words they've made up (like Dynos, or Chinchillas), you've probably got a problem on your hands. The truth about virtual computers is they operate under the constraints as physical computers. Because they are computers, and they exist in a physical location. This is why 'the cloud' is bullshit, because there is no cloud. Only machines, specific machines you have root access to.

3. Physical location. You want your VPS to be speedy, so this means getting it in a good physical location in relation to where the majority of your traffic is coming from. If all of your people are in NYC, don't get a server in Asia. There are of course ways you can set up your site to serve from multiple data-centers, but must of us won't need to do this. Just pick a good location near where you think the most of your peers are. When in doubt, make it close to you.

That's it. If you want specific recommendations, or have specific questions, feel free to get in touch with me. I'm at ev@evbogue.com
