_[Update Feb 5 2013] This post [trended on Bitcoin Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/17wuvy/why_coinbase_should_hire_me/). I heard back from Coinbase. Brian was really cool about it, but cannot hire me until I become a supercoder. My new mission in life: become a supercoder. Coinbase is still looking for supercoders, if you are one, please apply to [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/)._ 

This is the first in a series of posts I'm writing to get myself out of Gwen's grandmother's basement in NC and into the world of the living. 

By world of the living, I mean to San Francisco.

The idea came to me as I was sitting on my yoga mat talking to [Gwen Bell](http://gwenbell.com) just a moment ago. "Have you ever seen anyone ask to be hired for a job in public?" "No! Why not?" "I don't know." "Well, I have to try it out then."

I imagine most CEOs get stacks of resumes in their inboxes, and have trouble sorting through them all. By publishing to my own website, I imagine I'll jump the line.

The first resume I'm sending (err, well, posting), is to [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/).

Coinbase is a Bitcoin startup based out of San Francisco. Perhaps somewhere in SOMA near the cupcake shop that takes Bitcoins. I've been interested in Coinbase since their launch 8 months ago. 

Coinbase's premise (and promise) is simple: be the Paypal of Bitcoin. 

You can use Coinbase right now to transfer money in and out of Bitcoin using your bank account. Pretty cool, huh? Oh, and did I mention that Coinbase has raised a small amount of money via crowdfunding, and also got their first few dollars from Ycombinator.

Without further wait, here is my cover letter and resume to Coinbase's [Brian Armstrong](http://brianarmstrong.org/).

### The pitch

Hi Brian,

I'd like to apply for the position of employee #3 at Coinbase. 

Why?

I've been following Coinbase since you launched. In fact, I was probably one of the first people who clicked over to your blog. Initially, I was concerned that your business was going to be quickly cut short by a devastating hack because your wallets aren't encrypted serverside like Blockchain.info's. However, Coinbase seems to have made it 8 months without my worst fears coming true, so now I feel comfortable pitching you.

Also, after running out of money in Boulder, CO a few months ago and choosing this basement over the streets, I also need someone who would pay me to work for them.

I'd like to earn 100% in Bitcoins. Because your company is a Bitcoin exchange, this makes you an ideal candidate for hiring me. Then I can pay Ryan Singer in Bitcoins to live at his [20Mission loft](http://20mission.com/) and get his 5% discount for Bitcoin renters.

I saw your request on Hacker News for resumes a month or two ago. The level of expertise you were requesting kind of blew me away. I am no supercoder. However, I do know a few amazing developers if you'd like me to introduce you to them. 

I'm a little concerned that we might have very similar skill sets. I can do front-end bootstrap-centric development in my sleep. You seem to be able to do this as well, which is why Coinbase looks as sexy as it does.

Right now I'm obsessed with deploying Node.js apps. I think they're the future. Is Coinbase built on Bitcoin.js? Did you build it from scratch? Do you do API calls into Bitcoind? I'm open to learning, and helping your development team with mission-non-critical tasks.

In my experience at startups, inevitably a new CEO needs to bring on someone who can take all of the boring mundane repetitative tasks off their hands. As someone with a very similar skillset to you, I'd be the best candidate for that job.

### Brief resume

For the past three years I made a living from publishing online. I left San Francisco last year to travel the world, living and working as I travelled.

I helped launch Nymag.com's blog network in 2006-2009. I was the photo editor for three years.

I graduated from NYU in 2006 with a double major in Journalism and Dance. I worked in NYU's information technology department helping students get viruses off their machines. This is actually the most relevant work experience I have for your current position, because it was basically security customer service.

I worked at the Apple Store for six months after I graduated from college.

###Hire me.

So why should you hire me? Because I live breathe and sleep Bitcoin. I'm getting better at Node.js. I can do things you might be bored of doing. I'm not afraid of taking risks. I also consider myself an allstar in-person communicator. I'm fun to be around. I love eating burritos at Taqueria Cancun. 

What I need from you:

I have 42 US dollars right now, and 9.97 BTC. If you'd like to do an in-person interview, you'd need to fly me from North Carolina to San Francisco. One-way is fine. I can probably find a friend's floor to crash on, or perhaps you'd be willing to put me up at one of those hostels in the Tenderloin. 

I had to sell my computer to get out of Berlin last summer, so if you'd be willing to buy me a work laptop, I'd be grateful. After I get my first paycheck, I'd probably buy a computer from the Bitcoin store and install Ubuntu or Debian on it.

If you'd like to chat over [Skype](skype:evbogue), I'm open to that, too.

The sooner I can get out of this basement and back to work on things I care about the better. Let's do this.

Best,
Ev Bogue
