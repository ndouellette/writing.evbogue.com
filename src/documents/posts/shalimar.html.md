Somewhere on the border of the Tenderlion in downtown San Francisco is a tiny little northern pakistani place called Shalimar. It's open late. The mexicans behind the counter server the most amazing indian/pakistani food you've ever had. It's served on giant tacky china plates, with naan as long as your forearm covered in garlic and olive oil.

I've been using Shalimar as motivation. A quiet little mantra to get myself out of the basement, and back into the world. Ever since my writing business bottomed out in Berlin this past summer, I've been working on strategies to rejoin the world of the working. I think I'm onto something. Let's just say it involves Node.js.

Whenever you're having trouble making money, the best thing I can think of to help change that is to learn something new that not many other people know how to drive. It's nice to finally be driving something other people don't know how to use.

So here's my promise. Shalimar by my birthday. Saag paneer, here we come. 

I'll be 28 on March 4th 2013.
