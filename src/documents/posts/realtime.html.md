We've seen glimpses of the real-time web, but we haven't really got to know it yet. My prediction is over the next few years we will see the real-time web emerge. And it will be spectacular. 

[Node just hit 0.10 stable](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/03/11/node-v0-10-0-stable/). This means the Streams2 API is ready. This means some very interesting things can start happening with Node.js servers. Instead of just sending chunks and blocks, we're streaming data between servers and clients. 

Right now, you can't see the difference between your site and mine. Mine loads, yours loads. Yours might be on Wordpress, or a static generated site served via Apache. Mine is running on Node.js. This means all the content is rendered on the fly, when you need it. 

A node server is running all of the time. Imagine a spinning engine, answering requests for input and output. 

In the olden days, we settled for a server that spun up once in awhile, and then fell back asleep. A node server spins all day long. There is no idle. This means it can do some more interesting things. This means it can listen.

Now, the real-time web is uncertain. You can't go into Barnes and Noble and get a book about it. If you did, it'd be [out of date](http://writing.evbogue.com/posts/books). 

But that's why it's interesting. Because it's new, it's emerging. We don't have all of the answers yet.

Eventually, the real-time websites will pull ahead of the static. People won't want static websites anymore, they'll want real-time ones. 

The question is, will you be running a real-time site at that moment, or clinging to your static site wishing things weren't changing?
