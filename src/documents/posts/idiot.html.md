One of the things I've been surprised about over the past year has been the complete denial I've seen in the general population about Bitcoin. 

When I bring up Bitcoin, most people get so scared that they immediately start sweating, shivering and crying.

Another subset of the population immediately begins to dismiss Bitcoin 'that will never work!' because of one of the [Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths) myths.

Well, it does work. It's worked for four years. My Bitcoins are [worth so much more](http://preev.com) now than they were a few months ago. How much are your dollars worth...? Eh?

My point is, you don't have to be an idiot about Bitcoin. You can educate yourself about it. You can get fascinated by it. You can take a few of your precious USD and convert them into Bitcoins at your local Walmart or CVS. You can [email me](mailto:ev@evbogue.com), and I'll send you a few mBTC to play with. You can read the [Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/), or even [ask me](mailto:ev@evbogue.com).

You don't have to wait until the usd/euro/yen collapses to start caring about Bitcoin. You can start getting curious about it right now. Then, when your state controlled currency starts to look weak in comparison (if you don't think it looks weak already) you can make an educated decision about the currency you use.

Now, I'm not saying Bitcoin is perfect. There are definitely ways the technology can improve. My point is just this...

Bitcoin isn't that scary. It's just a distributed p2p way to exchange value over the Internet. 

Instead of being Mastercard/Paypal/The Fed/Your bank's bitch, you get to use money without being anyone's bitch.

So why are you still being an idiot about Bitcoin?
