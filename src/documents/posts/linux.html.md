One of the single most important things I did last year was switch to Linux.

It happened when I traveled through Boulder, CO in September. Erik, a wise homeless server-admin/developer (with higher standards than even I have) convinced me to make the switch. 'Why not try it out? You could always dual-boot'.

A week, and a whole lot of learning later, I had [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) installed on the MBA. (MBA is the Linux code word for Macbook Air.) I didn't dual boot. After wrestling with Apple's Mac OS X-centric bootloader for endless hours, I didn't want to anymore.

Linux feels to me like Mac felt ten years ago. It's an exciting development platform that's finally having its moment. Linux took the long, hard, road to being a successful platform. 

After using Linux for six months, I can safely say I'm not going back to Mac. All of the most talented develeopers I know are on Linux Linux, or will be soon.

Linux forces me to think about computers in an open way. 

Right now I'm running Ubuntu on my MBA. I'm running [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) on the VPS I pay for monthly with Bitcoin. This site is hosted on Linux.

If you're thinking about making the switch from a Mac. I say do it now.

You'll learn a lot more about your computer. 

You'll be using a superior operating system.

Linux gives you a competitive edge over everyone else.
