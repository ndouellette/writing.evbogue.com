title: You are not a developer (if you don't use Git)

Every once in awhile a technology comes along you just can't ignore. 

Git is one of these technologies.

Git lets me and you track everything. It keeps the code intact. It streams our code across the web from server to server, and server to client.

And when I say Git, I don't just mean Github. I also mean Gitboria. I also mean using Git on your own machine. I mean using Git however you want to use Git.

Git means we can collaborate on projects. It means you can make pull requests on my code, and I can make pull requests on yours.

Git means if something is broken on my website, you can take the initiatve to fix it. You don't have to email me anymore telling me it's busted. Just open an issue, and attach the code.

Using Git means we don't have to chat. We can just do the work. Which means writing the code we need to deploy.

Best of all, Git comes straight from the mind of Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.

Now Git isn't easy to learn. But if you don't know how to use it, I don't think you can call yourself a developer anymore. You're like a painter without a canvas, or a writer without paper. Your code isn't landing in the right place if you aren't using Git.

Now this doesn't mean everything you do needs to be public. Using Gitboria you have one barrier to entry: your people need to be a Hyperboria (if you can't get on Hyperboria, are you a hacker? Hah) Also, Gitlab is private by default. There's no clone access unless you've been added to the project, or the project has been made public.

So learn Git, or go home.
