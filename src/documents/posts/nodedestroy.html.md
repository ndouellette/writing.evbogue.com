I've been doing this very funny thing, which I never do, which is trying to get a job.

I haven't had a job since July of 2009, when I quit New York Magazine. I ended up in the online self-publishing business, and didn't look back. Now that I'm living in a basement, I figured, why not try to go back to the working world? It would be a new experience.

This has been disastrous, for one reason: Every established startup I've talked to is going to be destroyed by Node.

My initial memo to the recruiter emails is always: "Get on the Node boat! You'll have a product that's so awesome. I'll totally build it for you, if you give me resources, and get me out of this basement."

Their reaction is always the same. They don't say it, but they do: "We like our PHP/Ruby/Nonsense app from 2006 that's leaking users left and right. What we really want to hire was another aging developer who won't push us to look with clarity at the future."

This is a very dangerous way to approach your technology business right now. You want more people on your team who can see clearly into the future, not less.

My experience with Node.js over the past few months has led me to believe that it's going to make a lot of the startups from the early 2000's look very very old. It already is. A new generation of zippier, real-time web apps are being birthed. No one from the old guard wants to hear about them. 

They get together in IRC to mourn the web they're losing, they lost.

And that's the healthy response. Denial is the unhealthy response. Denial is so much easier than looking at your imminent destruction.

This is kind of like talking to bankers about Bitcoin. No one in the banking world wants to hear that I'm my own bank. I don't need them (and their bullshit) anymore.

No one in the last generation of shitty Apache/PHP startups wants to hear that Node is making them look bad.

So if you're a startup unwilling to contemplate your own destruction, we're not the right fit. 

Because Node is coming to get you.

Are you scared enough to do something?
