Over the past two years, I've learned 'The Cloud' is a bunch of bullshit.

It's a marketing ploy to convince you that if you upload your data to a server where it can be sorted by an algorithm. Then it will be sold back to you in the form of advertising. We all know who does this. With your permission, all of your data are belong to them.

The reality is, computers are not clouds. They are computers. When they exist in server farms, you can be convinced that they are clouds. They are not clouds, they are server farms. Your data is being uploaded to a server farm, where it is being copied a bajillion times for posterity. Chances are, if you wanted to delete it, you will not be able. That company will own your data forever. Because they don't even know where your data is, or how they would delete it if you asked them. Yes, they will delete the link they show you to the data, but your data will always be on their servers. In a farm. Not a cloud.

Clouds are in the sky. Sometimes they rain.

This matters to me, because. I like to be able to delete my shit. When I want to. So I don't keep it in clouds anymore. When I want to give you access to my data, I use commit it to Git and then distribute it. Not to a cloud, but it a specific virtual machine on a specific server (in my case, somewhere in Frankfurt, Germany) that I pay for. Then you can access it by typing in the IP address or a reference to that IP address.

This is how computers actually work. Not how people who want to squeeze your brain for dollars want you to think about computers, so they can sell your shit back to you.

I don't use 'Clouds'. Because I think they're bullshit.
