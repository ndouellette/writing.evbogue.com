Once in awhile I get requests for the books I've written. This is what I usually send in return.

"Well, what problem are you trying to solve?"

Nonfiction books exist to solve problems. At least the ones I've historically written, business books, digital strategy books, and personal dev books. The trouble is, in order to get ahead, we need to solve problems faster. By the time I write a book, the strategies included are bound to be obsolete. Even when I'm writing straight to the Internet.

I've been taking trips to Barnes and Noble, and print books are even older. Take a trip to your Barnes and Noble, and you'll quickly find there are very few books on the topics I write about. Bitcoin books? Nope. Node.js books? A few. There are no books on Golang, mesh networking or Hyperboria, and there's only one book on Git. 

This is because books are always behind. They take forever to write, forever to edit, and by the time you've read them they are very very far behind. Because you have to make the time to read them. And you've procrastinated until it's too late. Now your brain is behind.

And you know what books turn into once they're obsolete? Bullshit. 

One of the books I read over a coffee in Barnes and Noble this past month was Social Media is Bullshit. I'd recommend it, but by the time you've driven to Barnes and Noble and read the whole damn thing, the point will have already seeped into collective consciousness. 

The nut graf of the book is the cover. The trouble is, social media wasn't bullshit in 2009, but it is now. The funny thing is, this book is sitting next to a whole heap of books from 2009 that are now obsolete. A dude gets to write a book in 2012, telling you old books are bullshit. It lands, because it's true. And the other writers' past selves look like idiots, because they can't update their books. Because their books are printed on paper. But what about when distributed social media is invented and social isn't bullshit anymore? Well, then everyone in the tech/biz section has a problem, including the bullshit guy.

Books existed to solve problems, but now problems are solved too fast for books. 

Get it? If not, go read an out-of-date book.
