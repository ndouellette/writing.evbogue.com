The Olds ran out of gas thirty miles from Raleigh, NC. Is this a metaphor for my life? I asked. 

"We're techies." I said, to the state trooper. "Good with computers, bad with cars."

I'm in the basement because I'm too good with computers. In many ways, I'm an idealist. I like to believe technology can be used for good. I like to believe people have good intentions. The last half of last year almost changed my mind about that. Just asks the ghosts of Ilya Zhitomirskiy and Aaron Swartz. 

The truth is, technology uses people too. In 2012, I saw more people used by a piece of technology than I'd ever seen in my life. This is why I pulled the plug on centralized services. One time, twice, then dozens. The more times I say no, the more I'm able to see clearly the challenge we have in front of us.

One lesson I've learned is it's important not to go up directly against the systems you're trying to destroy. Just create new systems, and the old ones will, eventually crumble. We saw this with the music industry, the film industry, and book industry. Next well, I'll let you guess at what's coming next. 

What I do know is we need distributed p2p social. We need a way to connect with each other across space/time without giving a third party a warrant to censor and/or spy. Privacy is a human need -when we're deprived of it for too long, people start to lose their shit. The Tor project is a good start for this. If we can browse in peace, perhaps soon we'll be able to talk in peace. 

I was hoping we'd find a solution to the distributed social problem. However, either it's a harder problem than we think, or people just don't have the balls to fix it. Unable to find anyone who could answer this question for me, I've been poking around myself. I've been pouring over Node.js code, dozens or hundreds of Github archives, looking for the answer. 

What I do know is it, it's a hard problem. But it's made harder by two things.

1. You don't believe it's a problem worth solving.
Why? Either because you don't have balls. Or, you still think your follow count is worth something. Or both. Probably both.
2. There's huge corporations who want to see it remained unsolved.
We haven't been able to admit that many of the most successful companies of the past few years are unsuccessfully squeezing our brains for all of the advertising dollars they are worth. We being you. Because I've opted out.

So where do we go from here?

Here are a few things I'd like to do over the next month or two.

1. Get myself out of the basement.
2. Find a distributed p2p social server that actually works.
3. Free the human race from it's current situation of being ensalved inside three giant blobs of social garbage collection.

The first one seems doable. The trouble is that I'm entirely unable to tell you anything I don't think is true. So if you're looking for some sort of one-bite powderpuff answer to everything, try reading something else. 

If not, maybe you have the balls to hear what I'm writing right here. 
If you don't have the balls, then I'd like to ask if you'd be willing to [send a few dollars here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VH42PJCGS3DQU) from your extra-fat settled-down paycheck, so I can have more resources to solve this problem for you. Because obviously you're not going to do it.

Meanwhile, I'll be sitting here in the basement trying to pump an asychronous realtime stream from me to you.

In the meantime, I'll write here. You can subscribe by setting [evbogue.com](http://evbogue.com) to your default homepage. If you need instructions on how to do this, please see my above instructions for those of you who do not have balls.
