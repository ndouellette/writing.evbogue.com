Did you hear, there's another Internet?

I know, you thought there was only one. But there isn't. I'm on two. This Internet, and [Hyperboria](http://hyperboria.net).

I learned about Hyperboria around six months ago. I met Isaac Wilder of [the FNF](http://thefnf.org/) in Kansas City. After our meeting I became obsessed with mesh networking. This obsession led me down the rabbithole to Hyperboria.

Hyperboria is built on a routing technology called [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns).

From the cjdns Github:

	Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public key cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. This provides near zero-configuration networking without many of the security and robustness issues that regular IPv4 and IPv6 networks have.

	Why? 

	To give regular people more power over their communications.

This means that when you're using the cjdns-based Internet, your communication is safer.

This is all part of a movement called Evolve Beyond Reach. If our communications are being monitored on the regular Internet, why not create another Internet where they can't be?

I've been jumping in and out of Hyperboria for the past six months. I've watched as more and more services became available. You can see a list of [known hyperboria sites](https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Known_Hyperboria_sites). On Hyperboria, you can use [socialno.de](http://socialno.de/ev/) to connect with me and other hyperborians. You can get a hosted blog, and write your Hyperboria-only thoughts to other Hyperborians. Hyperboria has its own versions of Reddit and Hacker News.

The brilliance of Hyperboria is that it's hard to log in. There are barriers to entry. You have to build cjdns from source, you have to get on IRC and ask someone running a node to peer you in. But in the challenge is the beauty, because there are no idiots on Hyperboria. Every person I've met on this new Internet so far is 100% mad scientist genius. 

I'll see you inside. Those of you who can figure it out.
