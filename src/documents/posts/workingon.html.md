I've got to be honest with you, I'm living in a basement right now. In the middle of nowhere. 

Living in a basement is actually a really great situation, because I get almost endless hours of the day to work on code. 

Well, actually I've been waking up at 7pm, staying up all night, and falling asleep just after morning. I call this 'the hacker schedule'.

Though it's a far cry from the freedom I enjoyed last year traveling through Mexico, Singapore, Japan and Berlin - at least I have a lot of time to get the work done. When I'm not working I'm sleeping or eating pulled pork or these amazing packaged beef sticks. 

I've been learning how to deploy Node.js apps. I have my very own VPS. You're reading on it, right now. I pay for it monthly using the Bitcoin I've been hoarding since this past summer. 

Node.js is pretty brilliant actually. It makes a lot of the technologies we've used in the past to publish to the web look kind of silly now. Node.js + Docpad lets me write this post in markdown, save the file as workingon.html.md, throw it in a folder called 'posts' and everything just compiles from there. In real time. 

Yah, I know, Node is pretty cool.

These are the kinds of things you learn about when you're stranded in a basement in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do.

It's pretty hard to find decent documentation on Node.js itself. This is why I created [my Node.js page](/pages/node), to collect decent documentation, videos, and tutorials. It's a pretty small list. I have high standards.

If you find anything to add to the list, send it [my way](mailto:ev@evbogue.com).
