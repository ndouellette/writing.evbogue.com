In absense of a good peer to peer follow button, we will do this the hard way. 

This is a list of peers in the digital world. You've added yourself because you think my work is cool. I'm not adding anyone. You'll add yourself.

Do a pull request to add yourself using Git + Github at my website's git repository. This page is written in markdown, so please continue to use it throughout.

Under no circumstances will I add you over email. The only way to do this is via a pull request. Learn Git, or die a horrible death alone in the woods starving exiled by all of your loved ones. It's 2013, people, git it together.

Here's the rule: distributed peer to peer sites only. No **umblrs, **itters, ****books or other crappy websites selling your brain to the highest bidder. If you add a social profile to this page, I will lose all respect for you, forever. You're either for us, or against us. You can use Github to add yourself, but you cannot link to Github.
