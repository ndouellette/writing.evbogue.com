Peers
-----

In absence of a good peer to peer follow button, we will do this the hard way. 

This is a list of peers in the digital world. You've added yourself because you think my work is cool. I'm not adding anyone. You'll add yourself.

Do a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to add yourself using Git + Github at [my website's git repository](https://github.com/evbogue/docpad.evbogue.com/blob/master/src/documents/pages/peers.html.md). This page is written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), so please continue to use it throughout.

Under no circumstances will I add you over email. The only way to do this is via a pull request. [Learn Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started), or die a horrible death alone in the woods starving exiled by all of your loved ones. It's 2013, people, git it together.

Here's the rule: distributed peer to peer sites only. No crappy centralized social sites selling your brain to the highest bidder. If you add a social profile to this page, I will lose all respect for you, forever.
