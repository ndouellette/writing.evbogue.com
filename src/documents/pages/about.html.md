A brief history of Ev Bogue
--------------

I was born in Chicago in 1985. I was unschooled during my childhood and completed my undergraduate at NYU for journalism and dance. 

As of today, I'm a technical writer and web developer specializing in Node.js for the distributed web. For the past three years, I've moved around the world writing at the intersection of humanity and technology. 

Right now, I'm obsessed with learning and deploying with Node.js. I'm also fascinated by Bitcoin.

The current focus of my work is discovering and/or coding the distributed peer2peer social web. We deserve the freedom to be social online without having our brains squeezed for advertising dollars.

The best way to contact me is at <a href="mailto:ev@evbogue.com">ev@evbogue.com</a>. Until distributed p2p social is invented, visit my hardcoded activity stream on the <a href="http://evbogue.com">front page</a> of this site.

How I built this site
---------------

I built this site on Node.js, using Docpad, Express, Jade, and Stylus. I use Ubuntu on an MBA. I code using Sublime Text 2.
