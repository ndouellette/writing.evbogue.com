Why Bitcoin?
-------

I've been fascinated by Bitcoin since the end of 2011 when I read [an article about it](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/) in Wired. Since, the Bitcoin economy has stabalized with many more users, services, and a lot more safety. 

In 2013, Bitcoin is becoming a normal way to transact online and in person. 

I'm fascinated with Bitcoin because it gives me a way to earn and save with no middleman.
